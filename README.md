# ECMWF Code for Earth 2023

**ECMWF Code for Earth brings innovation and open source developments to the Earth science community**. 
It is a collaborative programme where each summer several developer teams from different backgrounds in weather, climate, atmosphere, computer sciences and software development team up with mentors from ECMWF to work on earth science-related software developments and applications.
<br>

Code for Earth is jointly funded by the [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)](https://www.ecmwf.int/), the two Copernicus services operated by ECMWF on behalf of the European Union (the [Copernicus Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu/) and the [Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/)) and [Destination Earth](https://www.ecmwf.int/destine) initiative, and supported by the two cloud programs [European Weather Cloud](https://www.europeanweather.cloud/) and the Copernicus Data and Information access service (DIAS) [WEkEO](https://www.wekeo.eu/).

## How it works

### 1. Call for Participation: 1 Mar - 12 Apr 2023
Browse through the [Code for Earth challenges](https://github.com/ECMWFCode4Earth/challenges_2023/issues), ask questions and together with the mentors, tailor your proposal. Submit your proposal by 12 April 2023.

### 2. Announcement of selected proposals: 27 Apr 2023
The selected Code for Earth 2023 project teams will be announced on 27 Apr 2023.

### 3. Coding period: 2 May  - 31 Aug 2023
The 4-month long coding period will start on 2 May 2023 and ends 31 August 2023. During this time, the selected teams will team up with experienced ECMWF mentors and experts in weather, climate, atmosphere, computer science or machine learning. 

### 4. Final Code for Earth day: 20 September 2023
The Code for Earth day is a celebratory closure of the programme. Each Code for Earth team will be invited to present their project results at a workshop which will be hosted in ECMWF's premises in Bologna, Italy.
