# ECMWF Code for Earth 2023

**ECMWF Code for Earth brings innovation and open-source developments to the Earth science community**. It is a collaborative programme where each summer several developer teams team up with mentors from ECMWF to work on earth science-related software developments and applications.
<br>

Code for Earth is jointly funded by the [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)](https://www.ecmwf.int/), [Copernicus](https://climate.copernicus.eu) and [Destination Earth](https://stories.ecmwf.int/destination-earth/index.html) initiative and supported by the two cloud programs [European Weather Cloud](https://www.europeanweather.cloud/) and the Copernicus Data and Information access service (DIAS) [WEkEO](https://www.wekeo.eu/).

## How it works

### 1. Call for Applications: 1 Mar - 12 Apr 2023
Browse through the [Code for Earth challenges](https://github.com/ECMWFCode4Earth/challenges_2023/issues), ask questions and together with the mentors, tailor your proposal. Applications closed on 12 April 2023.

### 2. Announcement of selected proposals: 27 Apr 2023
The selected Code for Earth 2023 project teams will be announced on 27 Apr 2023.

### 3. Coding period: 2 May  - 31 Aug 2023
The 4-month long coding period will start on 2 May 2023 and will last until 31 August 2023. During this time, the selected teams will team up with experienced ECMWF mentors and experts in earth science, computer science or Digital Twins. 

### 4. Final Code for Earth day: 20 September 2023
The Code for Earth day is a celebratory closure of the programme. Each Code for Earth team will be invited to present their project results.
